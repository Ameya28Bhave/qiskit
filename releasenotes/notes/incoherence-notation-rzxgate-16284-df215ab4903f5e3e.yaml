    Fixed the api documentation for :class:`.RZXGate` which was incoherent with its notation.
    The default notation for RZX gate was in big-endian and the example shown was in little-endian format.
    Fix is done in the example section where the gate notation is concatenated with q_0 , q_1 and 
    big-endian format is followed throughout. 
    For example intial notation was :
    R_{ZX}(\theta = 0) = I 

    Now it would be 
    R_{ZX}(\theta = 0)\ q_0, q_1 = I
